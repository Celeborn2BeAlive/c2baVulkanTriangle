# c2baVulkanTriangle

First triangle using Vulkan

Code based upon samples from https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

Trying to make it work with SDL2 >.<'
at that time, catch an assert because fpGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR() does not return 0 in vulkanswapchain.hpp

Project c2baVulkanTriangleFromSamples works fine, but is taken from https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

CMake only adapted for windows x64 visual studo 2015, for now.
